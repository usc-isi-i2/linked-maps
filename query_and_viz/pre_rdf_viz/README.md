# Setup Add on feature for visualization with Google Map on Jena

Note: You have to complete Apache Jena Installation first.

1) Navigate to ```/path/to/apache-jena-fuseki-3.9.0/webapp```
2) Replace existing files (or add new files if not existed) in your local folder with all files [here](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/linked-maps/tree/master/3%20-%20Query%20and%20Visualization%20(Jena)/Visualize%20RDF/webapp) i.e. ```dataset.html``` and all files in folder ```js``` .

Note: We sometimes have problem running this add on feature on Chrome. It works perfectly on MS Edge.
