# Query and Visualization 

To visualize the map segments using the RDF we exported in previous steps on Apache Jena:
1. Set up Apache Jena as described in README in directory `pre_jena`. Now we have standard Apache Jena.
2. Add WKT visualization feature as described in README in directory `pre_rdf_viz`. This will create an add-on feature to visualize WKT with Google Maps on Jena.
