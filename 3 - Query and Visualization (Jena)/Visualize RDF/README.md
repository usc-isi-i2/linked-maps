# Setup Add on feature for visualization with Google Map on Jena

Note: You have to complete Apache Jena Installation first.

1) Navigate to ```/path/to/apache-jena-fuseki-3.9.0/webapp```
2) Replace existing file (or add new file if not existed) in your local folder with all files here i.e. ```dataset.html``` and all files in folder ```js``` .

Note: We sometimes have problem running this add on feature on Chrome. It works perfectly on MS Edge.
